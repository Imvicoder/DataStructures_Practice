Two trees are called isomorphic if one of them can be obtained from other by a series of flips, i.e. 
by swapping left and right children of a number of nodes. Any number of nodes at any level can have their children swapped. 
Two empty trees are isomorphic.

For example, following two trees are isomorphic with following sub-trees flipped: 2 and 3, NULL and 6, 7 and 8.
