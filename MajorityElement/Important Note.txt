The basic solution is of Time complexity O(n^2). But there are other 2 solutions possible.
1)Using Self balancing Binary Search Tree---time complexity is O(nlogn) but if we use normal binary tree then T.C is O(n^2)
2)Using Mooreâ€™s Voting Algorithm----O(n)

These solutions will be updated soon....

Thanks..
